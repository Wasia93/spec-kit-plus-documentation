This is about the basic concepts understanding of spec kit plus
What is SPECKit Plus? – Short Note

SPECKit Plus is a structured development framework used in modern AI-focused software engineering. It gives developers a clear method to move from idea to a fully working product. Instead of jumping directly into coding, SPECKit Plus organizes the entire development process into simple and clear phases. This makes the workflow efficient, reduces mistakes, and ensures that the final product meets the real needs of users.

Five Core Concepts of SPECKit Plus
1. /constitution – (Project Purpose)

This is the foundation stage of the project.
In this phase we define:

The problem we want to solve

The value and importance of the project

Target users and expected benefits

It ensures that everyone understands the project goal and the direction before anything begins.

2. /specify – (Requirements Phase)

The Specify phase focuses on gathering and clarifying requirements.
We identify:

Key features

Constraints or limitations

What is included and excluded in the project

This phase turns the idea into clear and detailed requirements.

3. /plan – (Planning Strategy)

In the Plan phase, we convert requirements into a technical and execution plan.
This includes:

Selecting tools and technologies

Designing the system architecture

Creating a development roadmap

This makes future development smooth and organized.

4. /tasks – (Breaking Down Work)

This phase divides the big plan into smaller tasks.
We define:

Individual development activities

Execution order and responsibilities

This provides step-by-step clarity for the development team.

5. /implement – (Execution Phase)

This is where the actual development happens.
Developers follow:

The plan

The specifications

The task breakdown

This ensures the final solution is aligned with the original project idea and requirements.
